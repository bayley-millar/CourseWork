2)A FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file in a file system.
What files are available depends on the host environment.
FileInputStream is meant for reading streams of raw bytes such as image data.
For reading streams of characters, consider using FileReader
3)FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(file);
4)read(); it returns the next byte of data or -1 if the end of the file is
reached.
5)A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a File or to a
FileDescriptor. FileOutputStream is meant for writing streams of raw bytes
such as image data.
6)f = new FileOuputStream(file);

public static void main(String[] args){

public void print_words(String word, int n){
       int count = 0;

         System.out.println(word);
         count++;
