1.An InputStreamReader is a bridge from byte streams to character streams:
It reads bytes and decodes them into characters using a specified charset.
The charset that it uses may be specified by name or may be given explicitly,
or the platform's default charset may be accepted.

2.To enable the efficient conversion of bytes to characters, more bytes may
be read ahead from the underlying stream than are necessary to satisfy the
current read operation.

3.read(), returns:  A String containing the contents of the line, not
including any line-termination characters, or null if the end of the stream
has been reached

4.Prints a String and then terminates the line. This method behaves as though it
invokes print(String) and then println().

5.Creates a server socket, bound to the specified port. A port number of 0 means
that the port number is automatically allocated, typically from an ephemeral
port range. This port number can then be retrieved by calling getLocalPort.

6.Listens for a connection to be made to this socket and accepts it. The
method blocks until a connection is made.returns the new socket

7.public Socket(InetAddress address,int port)

8.an input stream for reading bytes from this socket.

9.public OutputStream getOutputStream()

10.a Date object
new Date()

11. Sys.out.println(new Date());

12. Port is required
Host is optional
